 Conducted an in-depth case study during my master's program, focusing on BoomBikes, a hypothetical shared bike service provider. Employed a Linear Regression model to predict post-quarantine bike demand in the American market amid COVID-19, utilizing data on meteorological and lifestyle factors. Created a predictive model to aid management in comprehending demand fluctuations based on various factors, offering valuable insights for strategic decisions and market analysis.
